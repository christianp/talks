                        <p>Welcome to Newcastle!</p>
                        <p>This conference is about getting together people from all around the world who are using computers to help assess their students' maths skills.</p>
                        <p>Thank you to those who've travelled a very long way to get here - I think we in the UK don't look outside enough at what our overseas friends are doing, so thanks for saving us the effort.</p>
                        <p>I'll briefly introduce you all to each other: you mainly work in HE. A few of you belong to commercial e-assessment providers. A handful of you work at school level.</p>

                        <p>Whenever I visit other institutions, it's rare to find a team who are aware of more than one or two different e-assessment systems.</p>
                        <p>Very often, one person has started up using something they found by chance, or has started writing their own thing from scratch.</p>
                        <p>How many of you are part of a <em>team</em> developing maths e-assessment material?</p>
                        <p>How many use a commercial system like WileyPlus or MyLab? Not bad, but what do you do when you want to do something new? And who owns your content?</p>
                        <p>Who are the heroes who make your own systems?</p>
                        <p>Finally, who has come from the magical land where everyone's committed to a good, maths-specific assessment system, with support from management and central IT?</p>

                    <p>Numbas was used in <strong>48 modules</strong> in the 2015/16 academic year</p>
                    <p>by <strong>2,000 students</strong>, who completed a total of <strong>40,800 attempts</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Core team of 3 developers, with lecturers writing some material.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>So to start, here's how it's going at Newcastle: quite well.</p>
                        <p>I'll talk in more depth about what we do later on.</p>
                        <p>But first, why do we need a <em>maths</em> e-assessment conference?</p>

                        <li>Marking maths questions is hardest of all</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>For e-assessment of maths to be any good, there are some must-haves that most e-assessment systems can't provide.</p>
                        <p>We hosted MatRIC a few months ago, and this message that maths is different came out loud and clear from everyone in attendance.</p>
                        <p>You can dispute my ordering of difficulty.</p>

                    <p>User experience is really important.</p>
                    <p>An e-assessment system should be <em>clear</em> and <em>intuitive</em>.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>"UX" is one of those nebulous concepts that people who know what they're talking about use.</p>
                        <p>I'm going to try to contrast bad UX with good, but picking apart systems made by people in the audience would be unkind.</p>
